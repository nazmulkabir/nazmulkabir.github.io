### Biography

I am Md Nazmul Kabir Sikder, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University](https://ece.vt.edu/). Since joining Virginia Tech in August 2019, I have been engaged in research at the [Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI)](https://cyberinitiative.org/), guided by [Dr. Feras A. Batarseh](https://www.bse.vt.edu/people/faculty/feras-batarseh.html). My work focuses on developing Artificial Intelligence Assurance methods, specifically robust and explainable cyberattack/outlier detection for cyber-physical systems in domains such as water distribution and agriculture.

Before this, at the Advanced Research Institute under [Dr. Saifur Rahman](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/rahman.html), I contributed to creating robust platforms for transactive energy systems. I earned my Bachelor of Science in [Electrical & Electronic Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://eee.buet.ac.bd/), the leading engineering university in Bangladesh, in September 2015. Following graduation, I served as a telecommunication engineer at [Grameenphone](https://www.grameenphone.com/), Bangladesh's largest telecom operator, from 2015 to 2019.

I am an experienced machine learning expert specializing in AI and cybersecurity for critical infrastructure. I have a proven track record of enhancing security and efficiency with ML solutions deployed in major U.S. facilities. Skilled in developing scalable AI models for real-time threat detection, I am committed to advancing data-driven technologies in high-stakes environments. My motto is: "Advancing data-driven technologies in high-stakes environments."

Anticipating my Ph.D. graduation in 2024, I am seeking full-time opportunities, particularly in machine learning research with tabular and time series data. For any inquiries or opportunities, please contact me at [nazmulkabir@vt.edu](mailto:nazmulkabir@vt.edu) or schedule a meeting with me using this [LINK](https://calendly.com/nazmulkabir-vt/30min).
