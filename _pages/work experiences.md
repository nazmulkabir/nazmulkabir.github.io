### Graduate Research Intern, Power System
**[BEMControls LLC](https://www.bemcontrols.com)**  
As a Graduate Research Intern, I contributed to the development of an open-source tool called Building Energy Management Open Source Software ([BEMOSS](https://bemoss.org)), designed by Virginia Tech School. My role involved designing and integrating load control devices from different manufacturers, ensuring compatibility with diverse communication technologies and data exchange protocols. Additionally, I quantified the benefits of Demand Response within the system.

### System Engineer, Telecommunication
**[GrameenPhone Ltd](https://www.grameenphone.com)** (2015 - 2019)  
I worked as a System Engineer at Grameenphone, focusing primarily on microwave transmission-related issues and RF optimization. My responsibilities included routine Operations and Maintenance (O&M), resolving IPPM loss, managing ping packet loss, and optimizing capacity for GSM, 3G, and LTE transmission. I also played a crucial role in RF interface optimization, with a focus on improving Minute Per Drop (MPD).

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Handling fault troubleshooting for BTS, transmission network, core network, and power equipment, ensuring adherence to defined service levels.
- Performing preventive maintenance of network elements to ensure optimal network quality.
- Supporting network growth and stakeholders by executing optimization and planned maintenance tasks.
- Managing and coordinating different vendors to secure the best services and implement operational expenditure (OPEX) efficiency initiatives.
- Preparing and presenting reports to meet internal requirements and support decision-making.

**Special Skills:**
- In-depth knowledge of GSM, 3G, LTE transmission, and power systems.
- Strong understanding of IP transmission and architecture.
- Excellent communication and project management skills.
- Knowledge of the Internet of Things (IoT).
- Experience in maintaining BOT tools for mobile Android applications used for network monitoring.

### Technical Contributions
- Carrier Ethernet implementation, replacing legacy E1 technology in the network.
- Deployment of NEC's 56MHz and 2048QAM (496 Mbps) Line-of-Sight (LOS) MIMO technology within the microwave transmission network.
- Part of Grameenphone's transition from a Communication Service Provider ([CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_service_provider)) to a Digital Service Provider ([DSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_service_provider)).
- Contributed to the roll-out of 10,000 network nodes across Bangladesh by June 2016, the largest deployment compared to other operators.

### Certifications
- **DWDM:** [OptiX OSN 8800 OTN Platform](https://www.huawei.com/en/technology-insights/optical)
- **OptiX RTN 900:** Hybrid TDM/IP Microwave Transmission Systems – June 2016
- **Huawei S2300 Switch:** Logical Configuration Workshop – February 2016
- **BTS 3900 O&M:** First Line Operations & Maintenance – December 2015
- **Strive Towards Excellence Program (STEP)** – November 2015

### Significant Contributions and Awards
- Executed an IPBH WAN upgrade from 10 Gbps to 20 Gbps – October 2016.
- Successfully deployed numerous LPC to MW paths to enhance network stability.
- Played a major role in the LTE roll-out in Dhaka, receiving two awards for the quickest launch—one from the Technology division and another for Dhaka Circle.
- Proactively addressed customer complaints by monitoring network quality, ensuring smooth coverage and excellent customer experience.
- Performed drive tests for over 200 locations in Dhaka, collaborating with technology teams for permanent solutions.
- Developed an Android application ([Telegram Bot](https://telegram.org/)) for network monitoring, simplifying network quality assessment.
- Designed and developed protection systems for power supply in sensitive devices like DWDM, IPBH routers, and HiT systems.
- Created a billing tool using C# to track 3rd party transactions and manage monthly activities.

- Abstract: This paper presents the analysis and design of a Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) which is economical and compact in size. The DC to DC converter used in the system is a SEPIC converter which eliminates the use of separate ground isolation circuits and reduces tracking time. The efficiency of this converter is better than the traditionally used Buck-Boost converter. Here Incremental Conductance method is used to get a stable output in varying solar irradiance levels. The proposed system also includes the elimination of PI controller for duty cycle modification, elimination of complex circuits for sensing current, and elimination of filters for accurate analog to digital conversion of voltage and currents. This system is tested and verified experimentally with a 135Wp solar panel in varying insolation levels.
