### Graduate Research Intern, Power System
**[BEMControls LLC](https://www.bemcontrols.com)**  
As a Graduate Research Intern, I contributed to the development of an open-source tool called Building Energy Management Open Source Software ([BEMOSS](https://bemoss.org)), designed by Virginia Tech School. My role involved designing and integrating load control devices from different manufacturers, ensuring compatibility with diverse communication technologies and data exchange protocols. Additionally, I quantified the benefits of Demand Response within the system.

### System Engineer, Telecommunication
**[GrameenPhone Ltd](https://www.grameenphone.com)** (2015 - 2019)  
I worked as a System Engineer at Grameenphone, focusing primarily on microwave transmission-related issues and RF optimization. My responsibilities included routine Operations and Maintenance (O&M), resolving IPPM loss, managing ping packet loss, and optimizing capacity for GSM, 3G, and LTE transmission. I also played a crucial role in RF interface optimization, with a focus on improving Minute Per Drop (MPD).

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Handling fault troubleshooting for BTS, transmission network, core network, and power equipment, ensuring adherence to defined service levels.
- Performing preventive maintenance of network elements to ensure optimal network quality.
- Supporting network growth and stakeholders by executing optimization and planned maintenance tasks.
- Managing and coordinating different vendors to secure the best services and implement operational expenditure (OPEX) efficiency initiatives.
- Preparing and presenting reports to meet internal requirements and support decision-making.

**Special Skills:**
- In-depth knowledge of GSM, 3G, LTE transmission, and power systems.
- Strong understanding of IP transmission and architecture.
- Excellent communication and project management skills.
- Knowledge of the Internet of Things (IoT).
- Experience in maintaining BOT tools for mobile Android applications used for network monitoring.

### Technical Contributions
- Carrier Ethernet implementation, replacing legacy E1 technology in the network.
- Deployment of NEC's 56MHz and 2048QAM (496 Mbps) Line-of-Sight (LOS) MIMO technology within the microwave transmission network.
- Part of Grameenphone's transition from a Communication Service Provider ([CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_service_provider)) to a Digital Service Provider ([DSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_service_provider)).
- Contributed to the roll-out of 10,000 network nodes across Bangladesh by June 2016, the largest deployment compared to other operators.

### Certifications
- **DWDM:** [OptiX OSN 8800 OTN Platform](https://www.huawei.com/en/technology-insights/optical)
- **OptiX RTN 900:** Hybrid TDM/IP Microwave Transmission Systems – June 2016
- **Huawei S2300 Switch:** Logical Configuration Workshop – February 2016
- **BTS 3900 O&M:** First Line Operations & Maintenance – December 2015
- **Strive Towards Excellence Program (STEP)** – November 2015

### Significant Contributions and Awards
- Executed an IPBH WAN upgrade from 10 Gbps to 20 Gbps – October 2016.
- Successfully deployed numerous LPC to MW paths to enhance network stability.
- Played a major role in the LTE roll-out in Dhaka, receiving two awards for the quickest launch—one from the Technology division and another for Dhaka Circle.
- Proactively addressed customer complaints by monitoring network quality, ensuring smooth coverage and excellent customer experience.
- Performed drive tests for over 200 locations in Dhaka, collaborating with technology teams for permanent solutions.
- Developed an Android application ([Telegram Bot](https://telegram.org/)) for network monitoring, simplifying network quality assessment.
- Designed and developed protection systems for power supply in sensitive devices like DWDM, IPBH routers, and HiT systems.
- Created a billing tool using C# to track 3rd party transactions and manage monthly activities.
