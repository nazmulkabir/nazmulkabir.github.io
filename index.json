Step 3: Personalize ✨ Icons CSS Step 4: Share 📡 Acknowledgements 🙏🏼 Motivation If you know me, you know I like using for just about anything. When it was time to create my first academic conference poster, I knew I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to waste any time moving between different software environments or copy-pasting and manually formatting text, tables, figures, and results.\nInstead, I wanted to generate a fully reproducible and nicely formatted conference poster using R Markdown. Turns out; the R package {posterdown} makes this quite simple! In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll briefly show you how to create your own poster using the posterdown package.\nFor a sneak peek of what you can do with posterdown, you can find my first posterdown creation here and the underlying code here.\nStep 1: Install {posterdown} First, we\u0026rsquo;ll install the posterdown package.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;posterdown\u0026quot;) After you\u0026rsquo;ve successfully installed posterdown, restart R.\nStep 2: Open a posterdown template After you\u0026rsquo;ve installed posterdown and restarted R, you should now be able to find a few new templates in your RStudio. Navigate to\nFile \u0026gt; New File \u0026gt; R Markdown ... \u0026gt; From Template\nand select any of the posterdown templates.\nClick to view screenshot There are three options available: Posterdown HTML, Posterdown Betterland, and Posterdown Betterport.\nWhile the HTML template looks more like a classic scientific poster, the Betterland and Betterport templates create a poster with a large amount of space dedicated to a main take-away message. The difference between the latter two is that Betterland is landscape-oriented, while Betterport is portrait-oriented.\nYou can find more about the different templates at the posterdown wiki.\nStep 3: Personalize ✨ After you\u0026rsquo;ve selected a template (I\u0026rsquo;ve gone with Posterdown HTML), you can simply 🧶 knit 🧶 it to see what the generated html document looks like. Next, you can personalize the poster to your liking, starting with the yaml at the top of the document (i.e., all the metadata specified between ---, such as title and author).\nThe posterdown package allows for quite a bit of customization. For example, you can set the dimensions of your poster using poster_height and poster_width; set fonts for the text and title of the poster using font_family and titletext_fontfamily; and you can set colors using primary_colour, secondary_colour, and accent_colour. For a comprehensive list of the yaml options, check out the Wiki of your chosen template.\nIcons Since we\u0026rsquo;re using R Markdown to create our poster, we can use any R package to further customize it. For example, I really like to use icons, so I used the icons package for this. First, I installed and loaded the icons package.\nremotes::install_github(\u0026quot;mitchelloharawild/icons\u0026quot;) #install icons package library(icons) #load icons package Next, you can write inline code (code between single back ticks) to customize your poster with icons. For example,\n`r icons::fontawesome(\u0026quot;github\u0026quot;)` will create an inline github icon:\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to further customize your icons, you can wrap the code above with the icon_style() function and pass additional comma-separated arguments, such as scale and fill to set the size and color of the icon.\nFor example,\n`r icon_style(icons::academicons(\u0026quot;osf\u0026quot;), scale = 2, fill = \u0026quot;#035AA6\u0026quot;)` will create a larger OSF icon in blue:\nCSS If you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you might want to customize your poster even more. In that case, posterdown allows you to pass a css file with further customizations. For example, as you may have noticed from spending more than 5 seconds on my website, I really like this color. I wanted all my bold text to show up in this color, so I did the following two things:\nCreate a css file with further customizations First, I created a style.css file in my working directory (i.e., the place where my .Rmd is located). In this css file, I specified my preferred color for bold text:\n:root { --text-bold-color: #035AA6; } strong { font-weight: bold; color: var(--text-bold-color); } Reference the css file in the yaml After creating my style.css file in the working directory, I referenced it in the metadata of my Rmd:\noutput: posterdown::posterdown_html: self_contained: true css: style.css Et voilà! My bolded text is now in my favorite shade of blue.\nStep 4: Share 📡 You will likely want to share your poster with an external audience; to do so, it helps to create a self-contained document by setting self_contained: true under output. In addition, I knew that I wanted to automatically generate a PDF for sharing, so I added the following line to my yaml:\nknit: pagedown::chrome_print And that\u0026rsquo;s it!\nAcknowledgements 🙏🏼 ❤︎ The posterdown package was developed by Brent Thorne\n❤︎ The icons package was developed by Mitchell O\u0026rsquo;Hara-Wild\nI hope this was helpful!

I recently discovered a new tool for doing just this, with the R package {raincloudplots}. The \u0026lsquo;rain\u0026rsquo; stands for the raw data, and the \u0026lsquo;cloud\u0026rsquo; stands for the data distribution. In this post, I showcase my first raincloud plot, and how to recreate it.\nStep 1: Install {raincloudplots} First, we\u0026rsquo;ll install the raincloudplots package from GitHub and load it.\nif (!require(remotes)) { install.packages(\u0026quot;remotes\u0026quot;) } remotes::install_github('jorvlan/raincloudplots') library(raincloudplots) Step 2: Simulate some data In one of my research projects, I\u0026rsquo;m planning to explore whether crowdsourced data analysis, also known as multi-analyst studies \u0026mdash; giving the same dataset to different teams of scientists, who independently analyze it to answer the same research question \u0026mdash; can increase the sway and credibility of scientific research. That is, are the results of multi-analyst (vs. single-analyst) studies more likely to sway someone\u0026rsquo;s prior beliefs?\nGive me some more background information on the data and research setting Before reading the results of a scientific study, study participants will report their prior beliefs in a specific phenomenon on a scale of 0% (very unlikely) to 100% (very likely).\ngraph LR A[Report \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; prior beliefs] A ==\u0026gt;B[Read \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; single-analyst results] A ==\u0026gt;C[Read consistent \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; multi-analyst results] A ==\u0026gt;D[Read inconsistent \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; multi-analyst results] E[Report \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; final beliefs] B ==\u0026gt; E C ==\u0026gt; E D ==\u0026gt; E style A fill:#f6d4d1,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px style B fill:#f6d4d1,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px style C fill:#f6d4d1,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px style D fill:#f6d4d1,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px style E fill:#f6d4d1,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px Afterwards, study participants will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: one group will read the results of a conventional, single-analyst study; one group will read the results of a multi-analyst study with consistent results; one group will read the results of a multi-analyst study with inconsistent result.\nAfter reading the study results, the study participants will again report their belief in the phenomenon on a scale of 0% (very unlikely) to 100% (very likely).\nBelow, I simulate some data that are in line with the hypotheses we\u0026rsquo;re planning to preregister: we expect that, compared to single-analyst studies, multi-analyst studies with inconsistent, highly variable results will negatively affect prior beliefs (i.e., research consumers will be less likely to believe in the reported phenomenon), while multi-analyst studies with consistent, positive results will positively affect prior beliefs.\nGive me some more information about the simulation For the prior beliefs of all three participant groups, we\u0026rsquo;ll make 500 random draws from a normal distribution with 𝜇 = 65 and 𝜎 = 5.\nFor the final beliefs of participants reading a single-analyst study, we\u0026rsquo;ll draw from a normal distribution with 𝜇 = 72 and 𝜎 = 6. For the final beliefs of participants reading a multi-analyst study with consistent results, we\u0026rsquo;ll draw from a normal distribution with 𝜇 = 75 and 𝜎 = 7.\nFor the remaining group (the inconsistent multi-analyst condition), we\u0026rsquo;ll draw from a normal distribution with 𝜇 = 55 and 𝜎 = 9. This reflects our hypothesis that beliefs in a phenomenon will decrease after observing a multi-analyst study with highly variable results.\nset.seed(3) prior \u0026lt;- replicate(n = 3, rnorm(n = 500, mean = 65, sd = 5)) final_single \u0026lt;- rnorm(n = 500, mean = 72, sd = 6) final_multi_consistent \u0026lt;- rnorm(n = 500, mean = 75, sd = 7) final_multi_inconsistent \u0026lt;- rnorm(n = 500, mean = 55, sd = 9) Step 3: Initialize the data-format For this step, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to choose between several possible designs that you can find here: e.g., a 1-by-1, 2-by-2, or 2-by-3 (repeated measures) raincloud. In my case, I have 3 different groups (the single-analyst condition, the consistent multi-analyst condition, and the inconsistent multi-analyst condition) with 2 measures each (prior beliefs and final beliefs), so I\u0026rsquo;m creating a 2 x 3 raincloud.\nThe {raincloudplot} function to set up the desired data format for a 2 x 3 raincloud is called data_2x2(). (Confusing, I know). For other options and how to initialize them, check out this page.\ndf_2x3 \u0026lt;- data_2x2( array_1 = prior[,1], array_2 = final_single, array_3 = prior[,2], array_4 = final_multi_consistent, array_5 = prior[,3], array_6 = final_multi_inconsistent, labels = (c('Prior Beliefs','Final Beliefs')), jit_distance = .09, jit_seed = 321) Step 4: Make it rain! 🌧 Finally, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the raincloud_2x3_repmes() function to create our 2x3 raincloud.\ncolors \u0026lt;- rep(c(\u0026quot;dodgerblue\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;darkorange\u0026quot;), 3) #choose colors raincloud_2x3_repmes( data = df_2x3, colors = colors, fills = colors, size = 1, alpha = .6, ort = \u0026quot;h\u0026quot;) + #set to v for vertical plot scale_x_continuous( breaks = c(1,2,3), limits = c(0.8, 4.3), labels = rep(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, 3)) + ylab(\u0026quot;Rated Beliefs\u0026quot;) + annotate(geom = \u0026quot;text\u0026quot;, label = \u0026quot;Single-Analyst\u0026quot;, x = 1.5, y = 42) + annotate(geom = \u0026quot;text\u0026quot;, label = \u0026quot;Multi-Analyst: Consistent\u0026quot;, x = 2.5, y = 38) + annotate(geom = \u0026quot;text\u0026quot;, label = \u0026quot;Multi-Analyst: Inconsistent\u0026quot;, x = 3.9, y = 38) + annotate(geom = \u0026quot;text\u0026quot;, label = \u0026quot;Prior Beliefs\u0026quot;, x = 4.2, y = 55, size = 5, color = \u0026quot;dodgerblue\u0026quot;) + annotate(geom = \u0026quot;text\u0026quot;, label = \u0026quot;vs.\u0026quot;, x = 4.2, y = 66, size = 5) + annotate(geom = \u0026quot;text\u0026quot;, label = \u0026quot;Final Beliefs\u0026quot;, x = 4.2, y = 77, size = 5, color = \u0026quot;darkorange\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() + theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.text = element_text(size = 9), axis.title.y = element_blank()) And we\u0026rsquo;re done!

One of my main motivations for using R to write up my manuscripts is contained in a tweet by Pamela Jacobsen:\nWhy does so much of academia involve cutting and pasting information from one document to another document?\nPamela Jacobsen (May 17, 2021)\nA reproducible workflow In the workshop, I go through methods that keep you from manually transcribing and/or copy pasting tables, figures, statistical output, and citations over and over again.\nPerhaps my favorite introduction to the idea of a reproducible workflow (and the horrors of a non-reproducible workflow) is given in this short YouTube video:\nBenefits The video hints at some of the benefits of a reproducible workflow.

ClusterJob is an automation system for high-throughput reproducible computations, created by Hatef Monajemi and David L. Donoho. Sherlock is Stanford\u0026rsquo;s High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.\nYou can also find an exact replica of this tutorial on a separate website I created for Statistics 285: Massive Computational Experiments, Painlessly, a course taught at Stanford University in Spring 2021. Note that Sherlock is, unfortunately, only accessible to the Stanford community.\nMy goal is to provide a relatively painless introduction to High Performance Computing at Stanford.\nStep 1: Setting up Sherlock Create an account Request a Sherlock account If you don\u0026rsquo;t already have a Sherlock account, now\u0026rsquo;s the time to request one. After creating an account, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to set up your access credentials using SSH keys, which allows for remote communication between your local machine and the cluster.\nSet up SSH connection To set up your connection, check if you already have SSH keys on your machine. You can do this in two ways:\n☞︎ Go to your home directory and navigate to the hidden1 .ssh folder\n☞︎ Go to your terminal and enter ls -al ~/.ssh\nIf you see a .pub file, you already have SSH keys set up. If you don\u0026rsquo;t, run the following in your terminal:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C \u0026quot;your_email@example.com\u0026quot; Now, all you need to do is copy your keys over to the remote cluster.\nssh-copy-id your-username@sherlock.stanford.edu #run this in your terminal Next, add the following to your ~.ssh/config file to avoid Two-Factor Authentication every time you access the cluster, either from your local machine or through ClusterJob.\nHost sherlock sherlock?? sherlock.stanford.edu sherlock??.stanford.edu ControlMaster auto ControlPath ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p ControlPersist yes #this enables direct access to sherlock using your terminal Host login.sherlock.stanford.edu ControlMaster auto ControlPath ~/.ssh/%l%r@%h:%p ControlPersist yes #this enables access to sherlock using ClusterJob Show me how to edit my ~.ssh/config file Editing your ~.ssh/config file can be done in two ways:\n☞︎ Directly, by navigating to .ssh \u0026gt; config from your home directory\n☞︎ Through your terminal, by running:\ncd ~/.ssh #change directory to the .ssh folder open config You can now check whether your connection works by trying to connect directly to the server. In your terminal, run:\nssh your-username@sherlock.stanford.edu The first time you do this, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely get a warning like this:\nThe authenticity of host 'login.sherlock.stanford.edu' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:eB0bODKdaCWtPgv0pYozsdC5ckfcBFVOxeMwrNKdkmg. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? Simply type \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo; and proceed. After completing these steps, your Sherlock account should be ready to go! 🎉\nStep 2: Setting up ClusterJob Create an account Create a ClusterJob account Set up an account with ClusterJob using your @edu email account. Take note of your chosen ClusterJob ID and the ClusterJob Key assigned to your account.\nInstall ClusterJob In your terminal, run:\ngit clone https://github.com/monajemi/clusterjob.git ~/CJ_install #clones CJ from GitHub sudo cpan -i Data::Dumper Data::UUID FindBin File::chdir File::Basename File::Spec IO::Socket::INET IO::Socket::SSL Getopt::Declare Term::ReadLine JSON::PP JSON::XS Digest::SHA Time::Local Time::Piece Moo HTTP::Thin HTTP::Request::Common JSON URI #installs perl dependencies alias cj='perl ~/CJ_install/src/CJ.pl'; #builds an alias for CJ Set up SSH configuration You just installed a CJ_install folder to your home directory. In it, you will find two important files that you\u0026rsquo;ll need to edit: cj_config and ssh_config.\nIn cj_config, you\u0026rsquo;ll provide your ClusterJob ID (the username you chose) and the ClusterJob Key you received when creating your account.\nCopy the following into the cj_config file:\nCJID\tyour-id #edit this\tCJKEY\teyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJhZG1pbiI6MCwiZCI6eyJ1aWQiOiJzaGlsYWFuIiwiY2pwYXNzY29kZSI6IjJmYWQ2OWU1YjZlNDQxNDE2NjhhOTIxZThiMmNlNTYwIn19.P60piuQFOmzny9dFmwWoWDGeNrtsi6UHl_16OIdoICa-C6Y8KeGadT6pcMJvyKLlBs163rR_p1CXkm33l6L8fhH9tsJGG3UN4cMocWsVeWH_ORfZsdNvuWa24IO2Yh7MPMTj067e9UodDcOYe7N2swu9eWfvC82YBk7Ubna3ZDnHi4icK06exK1_mIj8jv0fDzHS4m0eWd5u0Sg1YecMp9YXU3DEc_l3Hxroyc_qnfVmK9WhiDTfAx6ZYoHxFF2VecWVsOB6-Pq6cjYKKw7BQIiLbQ0VLIZmwjX3QiQRTvi6vX4vsfwxHTvsNKGE_L2ru9NAfcuRigX1mgOCLBwU9g #edit this\tSYNC_TYPE\tmanual\tSYNC_INTERVAL\t300 The cj_config file is somehow very sensitive to spacing and line breaks. Make sure you add linebreaks, like in the example above, or you\u0026rsquo;ll get obscure error messages when running ClusterJob. In ssh_config, you\u0026rsquo;ll provide information about the Sherlock cluster. Copy the following into the ssh_config file:\n[sherlock2] Host\tlogin.sherlock.stanford.edu User\tyour-username\t#edit this to your own username Bqs\tSLURM Repo\t/scratch/users/your-username/CJRepo_Remote #edit this Python\tpython/3.8.8 Pythonlib\tIPython:pandas:numpy:libgcc:scipy:matplotlib:cvxpy:-c conda-forge Alloc\t--time 48:00:00 --mem 32G R\tR/3.4.0 Rlib\tggplot2 [sherlock2] Show me how to edit my cj_config and ssh_config files Again, you can edit these two files through your terminal or manually:\n☞︎ Directly navigate to CJ_install \u0026gt; cj_config/ssh_config from your home directory\n☞︎ Through your terminal, run:\ncd ~/CJ_install open cj_config open ssh_config We\u0026rsquo;re ready to check if everything is working correctly. In your terminal, run:\ncj init #initialize your CJ agent cj who #check if the agent is installed cj update #update to newest version Step 3: Submit your first job ⚒︎ Here\u0026rsquo;s where the real benefit of ClusterJob comes in. To run a job on Sherlock, you normally have to write a job submission script describing your resource request and submission options. ClusterJob automates this process and does it for you! No need to learn anything about Sherlock\u0026rsquo;s job scheduler, Slurm.\nRun your first serial computation The CJ_install folders comes with some example scripts to run, so let\u0026rsquo;s give those a try.\nShow me the script I\u0026rsquo;m about to run # This is a test Python script for CJ # Author: Hatef Monajemi June 11 2017 import numpy as np; import csv; SUID = 'monajemi' file = SUID+'_results.csv'; Var0 = np.array([1,2,3]); Var1 = [1,2]; with open('file.txt','w') as myfile: for i in range(len(Var0)): for j in range(len(Var1)): # This is a comment # write to a text file for testing reduce with open(file,'a') as csvfile: resultswriter = csv.writer(csvfile,delimiter=','); resultswriter.writerow([i,j,Var0[i]+Var1[j] ]); In your terminal, run:\ncd ~/CJ_install/example/Python/ #change directory to the folder with Python example cj run simpleExample.py sherlock2 -m “A message.” #run your first serial job! When you run the second command, starting with cj run, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a message like this:\nCJmessage::initiating package 0df1b4e7 In this case, 0df1b4e7 is your job ID (referred to by ClusterJob as pid, for process identifier); take note of it.\nShow me what my CJ messages should look like CJmessage::initiating package 0df1b4e7 CJmessage::runing [simpleExample.py] on [sherlock2] with: alloc: --time 48:00:00 --mem 32G CJmessage::sending from: /Users/shilaan/CJ_install/example/Python CJmessage::Creating/checking conda venv.

CJmessage::1 job(s) submitted (24992894) After you\u0026rsquo;ve successfully submitted your job, you can check its status by running:\ncj state When your job is done, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a message like this:\npid 0df1b4e7aed70b1a367212f861729d0bc8fcfc29 remote_account: shilaan@login.sherlock.stanford.edu job_id: 24992894 state: COMPLETED Now, another one of ClusterJob\u0026rsquo;s benefits: it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to get the results of your job back onto your local computer. Run:\ncj get 0df1b4e7 #replace with your own job id Now, you\u0026rsquo;ll get the following message:\nCJmessage::Getting results from 'sherlock2' CJmessage::Please see your last results in /Users/shilaan/CJ_get_tmp/0df1b4e7aed70b1a367212f861729d0bc8fcfc29 Your results are ready for viewing! 🥳 The mentioned folder will include your results, your original script, and a script that fully reproduces the results.\nRun your first parallel computation We can rerun the same job we just submitted, but this time do it in parallel. The script we ran included a for loop over 6 elements (or index combinations). Instead of running this script serially, we can run it in parallel: we can submit a separate job for each index combination. In other words, we\u0026rsquo;ll submit 6 separate jobs to Sherlock. Again, ClusterJob will fully automate this process for you.\nIn your terminal, simply run:\ncd ~/CJ_install/example/Python/ #change directory to the folder with Python example cj parrun simpleExample.py sherlock2 -m “A message.” #run your first parallel job! Now, you should receive the following message:\nCJmessage::6/6 job(s) submitted Show me what my CJ messages should look like CJmessage::initiating package 30236535 CJmessage::parruning [simpleExample.py] on [sherlock2] with: alloc: --time 48:00:00 --mem 32G CJmessage::sending from: /Users/shilaan/CJ_install/example/Python CJmessage::Creating/checking conda venv.

CJmessage::Submitting job(s) CJmessage::6/6 job(s) submitted (24994033-24994039) To get the results, we have to first reduce the results of our parallel run into a single file. To do this, we have to identify the file that contains our results \u0026ndash; in this case, monajemi_results.csv \u0026ndash; and include our job ID. In your terminal, run:\ncj reduce monajemi_results.csv 30236535 #change to your own job ID You\u0026rsquo;ll be asked if you want to submit the reduce script to the queue via srun. This is recommended for big jobs, but in this case you can simple answer n. Afterwards, you\u0026rsquo;ll get the following message:\nCJmessage::Reducing results done! Use \u0026quot;CJ get 30236535 \u0026quot; to get your results. Show me what my CJ messages should look like CJmessage::30236535 CJmessage::Checking progress of runs...

Afterwards, you should get a message like this:\nCJmessage::Please see your last results in /Users/shilaan/CJ_get_tmp/3023653586353cab1f4601074519eec3c34f9346 Navigate to the folder to see the results of your parallel computation!\nAcknowledgements ❤︎ Statistics 285 Teaching Team\n❤︎ Mahsa Lotfi and Andrew Donoho, who went above and beyond in helping me get set up\n❤︎ The ElastiCluster and Clusterjob Tutorial, written by Mahsa Lotfi\n❤︎ The ClusterJob documentation\n❤︎ The Sherlock documentation\nOn Mac, you can view your hidden folders using Command + Shift + .\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":1621728e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621797623,"objectID":"2454d931274dae3774a2183744627a9e","permalink":"https://nazmulkabir.com/post/high-performance-computing-at-stanford/","publishdate":"2021-05-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/high-performance-computing-at-stanford/","section":"post","summary":"A step-by-step guide to running massive computational experiments using ClusterJob and Sherlock, aimed at the Stanford community.","tags":[],"title":"High Performance Computing at Stanford","type":"post"},{"authors":["Nazmul Kabir Sikder"],"categories":["rmarkdown","github","tidyverse"],"content":" Table of Contents Prerequisites Resources for getting started with GitHub Step 1: Create GitHub repository Step 2: Create project with Version Control in RStudio Step 3: Create website with {blogdown} Step 4: Push ⬆︎ to GitHub Step 5: Deploy site with Netlify Step 6: Customize your site with Wowchemy 🎨 Personal information Widgets Menu Theme Website icon Step 7: Write your first post ✍ We\u0026rsquo;re done! 💪 Acknowledgements I finally decided to bite the bullet and create my own website using {blogdown}. If you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you\u0026rsquo;ve already seen many inspiring examples of websites created with blogdown (for example, the webpages of Julia Silge, Silvia Canelón, and Iván Mauricio Cely Toro), but the process of creating it sounds slightly overwhelming. 😰\nIf so, this post is for you: I\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through my step-by-step process of building a site using blogdown and the Wowchemy theme for Hugo and deploying it with Netlify. I largely followed the process documented here by Alison Hill. The good news: we\u0026rsquo;ll mostly build and customize the website from the comfort of RStudio. 🥳\nMy goal is to write a concise step-by-step guide without having you worry too much about what\u0026rsquo;s happening behind the scenes. For a much more comprehensive guide, please check out Alison\u0026rsquo;s blog.\nPrerequisites Install a recent version of R and RStudio\nCreate a GitHub account\nConnect RStudio to GitHub (preferably with HTTPS)\nSign up with Netlify using your GitHub account\nResources for getting started with GitHub ⚒︎ Happy Git and GitHub for the useR\n⚒︎ The Turing Way Guide for Collaboration\n⚒︎ Start Your Lab guide 1\nStep 1: Create GitHub repository Click to create a new repository Use the following settings:\n✓ Keep the repository Public\n✓ Add a README file\n✓ Do not add .gitignore Click to view screenshots for Step 1 Step 2: Create project with Version Control in RStudio ☞︎ Go to https://github.com/your-username/your-repository\n☞︎ Click on the green Code button\n☞ Copy the HTTPS link to your clipboard\n☞ Go to RStudio \u0026gt; File \u0026gt; New Project \u0026gt; Version Control \u0026gt; Git\n☞︎︎ Copy paste the HTTPS link under Repository URL\n☞ Click Create Poject\nClick to view screenshots for Step 2 Step 3: Create website with {blogdown} install.packages(\u0026quot;blogdown\u0026quot;) # install the blogdown package library(blogdown) # load blogdown new_site(theme = \u0026quot;wowchemy/starter-academic\u0026quot;) # create your website!

Click on the \u0026ldquo;Show in new window\u0026rdquo; icon next to the 🧹 to preview your site in a browser window.\nClick to view screenshots for Step 3 Step 4: Push ⬆︎ to GitHub In the console, run the following line of code to create a .gitignore file:\nfile.edit(\u0026quot;gitignore\u0026quot;) Add the following lines to the .gitignore file:\n.Rproj.user .Rhistory .RData .Ruserdata .DS_Store Thumbs.db Before we make our first commit, we use blogdown to check all our files:\nblogdown::check_site() This will give you a number of [TODO] items, like adding public and resources to the .gitignore file, which you can do safely. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about content flagged as draft or files with a future publish date. If you have a [TODO] item related to your .Rprofile, run blogdown::config_Rprofile().\nAfter running these checks, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to commit to GitHub! 🎉\nShow me how to commit to GitHub ☞ Go to the Environment Pane\n☞ Click on Commit under Git\n☞ Check ☑︎ files to Stage them\n☞ Write a commit message\n☞ Commit and then Push ⬆︎ Step 5: Deploy site with Netlify Log in to Netlify with GitHub After logging in to Netlify through GitHub, you can deploy2 your website and change the url to your preferred site name, as follows:\n☞ Select New site from Git \u0026gt; Continuous Deployment: GitHub\n☞ Select your website repository\n☞ Deploy Site\n☞ Settings \u0026gt; Site information \u0026gt; Change site name\nBack in RStudio, change the baseurl to your new link in your configuration file:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;rstudioapi\u0026quot;) library(rstudioapi) # to easily navigate to files rstudioapi::navigateToFile(\u0026quot;config.yaml\u0026quot;) In config.yaml, set the following:\nbaseurl: 'http://your-site-name.netlify.app' # use the link you just created Before committing, let\u0026rsquo;s again run\nblogdown::check_site() # checks to resolve critical [TODOs] before commit Among other things, you need to make sure that the version of Hugo that you are using locally with {blogdown} matches the version used by Netlify (which is specified in netlify.toml). You will likely need to change your netlify.toml file. Remember that you can easily navigate to this file using\nrstudioapi::navigateToFile(\u0026quot;netlify.toml\u0026quot;) Step 6: Customize your site with Wowchemy 🎨 It\u0026rsquo;s time to customize! ❤︎\nPersonal information First, we\u0026rsquo;ll edit the About information (called a widget) on your homepage.\nrstudioapi::navigateToFile(\u0026quot;content/authors/admin/_index.md\u0026quot;) ☞ Fill in the _index.md with your personal information (find mine here)\n☞ Personalize with desired icons ☞ Add your picture called avatar.jpg to the content/authors/admin/ folder\nTo change (or remove) the title of your About widget,\nrstudioapi::navigateToFile(\u0026quot;content/home/about.md\u0026quot;) set title: My new title\nShow me what a personalized page looks like The about page: The shortened bio (appears under your blogposts): Widgets To get rid of and rename the other widgets on your homepage,\n☞ Go to the Files tab on your Viewer pane\n☞ Open the .md of a widget you wish to deactivate, e.g. hero.md 3 ☞ Write active:false\n☞ Change titles to your liking with title: My new title\n☞ Repeat for all other widges you wish to deactivate or personalize\nI wanted to start with a pretty minimal webpage, so I deactivated all widgets except for about.md and posts.md.\nClick to view a screenshot for this step Menu Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve deactivated some widgets, you\u0026rsquo;ll no longer want to link to them in your main menu (the navigation bar at the top).\nCustomize your main menu in config/_default/menus.yaml\nrstudioapi::navigateToFile(\u0026quot;config/_default/menus.yaml\u0026quot;) ☞ name: My new name to change the name of your menu items\n☞ Remove the links to widgets that you deactivated (here\u0026rsquo;s my menus.yaml)\nTheme ☞ Pick a built-in Wowchemy color theme\n☞ rstudioapi::navigateToFile(\u0026quot;config/_default/params.yaml\u0026quot;)\n☞ Set theme: rose (or whichever your chosen theme is; no capitalization)\nI initially chose the Rose theme, but decided I wanted to further customize the color theme using the steps outlined here:\n☑︎ I located the rose.toml file4\n☑︎ I created a new data/themes/ folder at the root of my site\n☑︎ I copied the rose.toml file into data/themes/shilaan_theme.toml\n☑︎ I adjusted the colors as desired using HTML color codes\n☑︎ I set theme: shilaan_theme in config/_default/params.yaml\nYou can also customize the font set.\nShow example GitHub files for creating my own theme data/themes/shilaan_theme.toml\nconfig/_default/params.yaml\nWebsite icon By default, your website will be published with the Wowchemy icon in the web browser tab. For example: To get your own Website icon, save a square 512x512 pixel image named icon.png in your root assets/media/ folder. My webpage should now show up in your Browser like this: I followed the steps but my Website icon hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed I ran into this issue. Simply clear your website from your browser history. 🧼 I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize the problem was caused by my cache until finding this issue.\nStep 7: Write your first post ✍ To remove the example posts currently populating your website (e.g., Welcome to Wowchemy, the website builder for Hugo), navigate to content/post and remove the folders associated with them (in this case, the getting-started folder).\nIf you find these posts helpful, you can always take another look at them on the Demo site and find their underlying files at themes/starter-academic/exampleSite/content/post.\nIf you really want to keep these files on hand, you can save them as a draft so that they don\u0026rsquo;t publish on your site anymore. You will still see them in your preview when you serve your site locally. For example:\nrstudioapi::navigateToFile(\u0026quot;content/post/getting-started/index.md\u0026quot;) Now, set draft:true in the front matter. From now on, whenever you run blogdown::check_site(), you will be reminded that you have these files marked as drafts.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re ready to write!\nIn your console, type\nblogdown::new_post( title = \u0026quot;My first post\u0026quot;, ext = '.Rmarkdown', subdir = \u0026quot;post\u0026quot; ) In your Files pane, you will now have a folder (under content/post) with today\u0026rsquo;s date and the title of your post. The crucial file is index.Rmarkdown: this is where you will write your post.\nGo ahead and open index.Rmarkdown. When you knit this5, your website will preview in the Viewer pane. Remember that you can click on the \u0026ldquo;Show in new window\u0026rdquo; icon next to the 🧹 to preview your site in a browser window.\nMake sure you edit the index.Rmarkdown file, not the index.markdown file. The markdown file is automatically created and updated when you knit your Rmarkdown. Go ahead and add an R code chunk:\n```{r echo=FALSE} library(ggplot2) x = seq(-1, 1, .01) y = sin(x^3)/(1 + x^6) ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_line() + geom_ribbon( aes(ymin = 0, ymax = y), fill = \u0026quot;pink\u0026quot;, alpha = 0.5 ) + theme_void() ``` Knit your Rmarkdown. Check out what it looks like, write your own content, and push⬆︎ to GitHub when you\u0026rsquo;re ready. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget about the option to run blogdown::check_site().\nShow me screenshots of this step We\u0026rsquo;re done! 💪 I hope this was helpful!
